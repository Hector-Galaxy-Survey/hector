Hector  
====

The master branch of this repo has been copied from SAMI repo hector-dev branch on 1 July 2022. 
From now on we use Hector repo to develop dr pipeline!

Below will be updated later...
The Hector python package contains functionality for running the data reduction process described in Sharp et al. (2014). See also Allen et al. (2014) for an assessment of the quality of the finished products.

There is currently no automated installation. Instead you should place the source code in your `PYTHONPATH` and make sure you have the following packages installed:

* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* astropy
* bottleneck (optional)

The initial data reduction steps also make use of 2dfdr, which is developed by the Australian Astronomical Observatory and [available here](http://www.aao.gov.au/science/software/2dfdr).
